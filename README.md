# react-intro

Welcome to React! This project leads you through the creation of a (very) simple
React application that queries the forecast.io API for weather.

## how to use it

The lessons in this application are set up in issues and pull requests in the
GitHub repo. I don't know if that will work well but I've had the idea and now
I'm going to try it! Congratulations lucky winners.

## lessons

### lesson 0

Design first! This README is lesson 0.

### lesson 1

Set up a `package.json` and install some dependencies.

Start to serve a simple HTML page with expressjs.

### lesson 3

Write the simple React components that structure the application UI.

### lesson 4

Fetch data from forecast.io to show Portland, OR's (surprisingly nice) weather
(at the time of writing).

### lesson 5

Use geocoding API from datasciencetoolkit.org to allow multiple cities to be
entered by the user, showing form input and iteration.

### lesson 6

Go forth and React!
